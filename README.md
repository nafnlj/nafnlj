## Nicholas A. Ferrell's Profile README ðŸ‘‹

I am the administrator and editor of two WordPress-powered websites. I post long-form articles on [*The New Leaf Journal*](https://thenewleafjournal.com/), the online writing magazine where the leaves are perennially virid, and short-form posts on [*The Emu CafÃ© Social*](https://social.emucafe.org/). I write about things I am interested in, which includes, but is not limited to: Anime, Brooklyn, Current Events, History, Linux, Open Source Software, Reading, Sports, Video Games, Visual Novels, Walking, Writing, and many other topics. I mainly use GitHub to follow projects and repositories that interest me.

## The Emu CafÃ© Social Micropost Activity Stream

I created a "social" [profile](https://social.emucafe.org/patrons/naferrell/profile/) on *The Emu CafÃ© Social*. It has a micropost activity stream which is separate from the main part of the site. You can see it [here](https://social.emucafe.org/patrons/naferrell/). It has an [ATOM feed](https://social.emucafe.org/patrons/naferrell/activity/feed/atom/) if you want to add it to your reader.
