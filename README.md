## Nicholas A. Ferrell's Profile README üëã

I am the administrator and editor of two WordPress-powered websites. I post long-form articles on [*The New Leaf Journal*](https://thenewleafjournal.com/) and short-form posts on [*The Emu Caf√© Social*](https://social.emucafe.org/). I write about thinks I am interested in, which includes, but is not limited to: Anime, Brooklyn, Current Events, History, Linux, Open Source Software, Reading, Sports, Video Games, Visual Noevls, Walking, Writing, and many other topics. I mainly use GitHub to follow projects and repositories that interest me. I do maintain some WordPress-related repositories on [my Gitea instance](https://giteacoffee.emucafe.org/naferrell). My day job involves legal research and writing in the area of U.S. immigration law.
